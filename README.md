# Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction

![Kidney](https://img.icons8.com/external-wanicon-flat-wanicon/64/000000/external-kidneys-medical-wanicon-flat-wanicon.png)

## Overview
This project aims to predict Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using machine learning techniques. Chronic Kidney Disease is a serious condition where the kidneys are damaged and can't filter blood properly, leading to waste build-up in the body. Early detection and prediction of CKD can significantly improve patient outcomes.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from [source name/link]. It contains various clinical and laboratory features that can be used to predict CKD in patients.

## Models Used
We have implemented and compared the performance of multiple machine learning models for CKD prediction, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting

## Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you will need:
- Python (version x.x)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/CKD_Prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd CKD_Prediction
   ```
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook CKD_Prediction.ipynb
   ```
5. Follow the instructions in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate their performance.

## Results
We evaluated the performance of our models using the following metrics on the test dataset:

Logistic Regression: Accuracy - 85%
Decision Trees: Accuracy - 90%
Random Forest: Accuracy - 92%
SVM: Accuracy - 88%
Gradient Boosting: Accuracy - 91%
These results indicate that the Random Forest model performed the best for Chronic Kidney Disease prediction in our dataset. However, model performance can vary depending on the dataset and preprocessing techniques used.
